            "Chiari 1.5 malformation, or bulbar variant of Chiari 1 malformation, is a term used in the literature to describe the combination of cerebellar tonsillar herniation (Chiari 1) along with caudal herniation of some portion of the brainstem (often obex of the medulla oblongata) through the foramen magnum. It is believed that whencongenital, it is the progression of Chiari 1 malformation. (See Fig. 3)"
